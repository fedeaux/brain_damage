Description:
    Brain Damage is used to generate ajax scaffolds with ease

Example:
    rails generate brain_damage:install
    This will create:
        helpers/brain_damage_helper.rb

    rails generate brain_damage:scaffold same args that would go with scaffold
    This will create:
        more files than scaffold, and it will be ajax :D
